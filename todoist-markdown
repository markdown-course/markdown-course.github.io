# Todoist

[Todoist](https://todoist.com/) is an online to-do list application that is available on the web or mobile device. My wife and I use Todoist to make grocery lists, setup reminders about upcoming events, and to manage a honey-do list for all of those things around the house she's always nagging me about. 

What I love most about Todoist is the organizational features it provides lists. I can keep track of separate todo lists in the form of projects. I can create sub-sections within those projects and even create sub-tasks for my tasks.

**Markdown in Todoist**

Markdown support in Todoist is limited. Even though Todoist Markdown is based on Commonmark don't expect to be able to use the full list of Markdown syntax. What it does offer includes basic text formatting, links, quotes, lists, code blocks, and emojis.

After I read through the [markdown guide](https://todoist.com/help/articles/text-formatting) for Todoist I immediately started using emojis. I find that including emojis makes the text a little less boring and provides a more associative experience for me.

Here is an example from the Todoist site:

Links are nice to have so that if I have a list of blog posts I'd like to read I can include them with link text rather than having a list of ugly urls.

Todoist's list of supported Markdown syntax works very well in task names and comments. However, there are a few cases where Markdown in Todoist doesn't work so well in task descriptions.
 
 For example, my unordered list looks fine here in the task view.
 
 ![Task View]()
 
 But it doesn't look so good in the task list view.

 This particular bug seems to be limited to the following features:
 - Unordered list
 - Code block
 - Block Quote
 - Horizontal Line

Overall, the Markdown support that Todoist offers is helpful since it does allow me to add a bit of extra styling and links to my todo items. Even though Markdown support is lacking in comparison to other applications I am totally okay with that. Todoist's purpose is for organization of tasks and not for publishing. The fact that it offers some Markdown support is more like icing on the cake.
